EDITOR OPTIMIZATIONS 

if you can, since the event function is going to be called a lot
move as many of it's variables to a place where they will be permanently allocated....
this means you won't have to make an allocation for every event loop
which will make the event loop slightly faster
the less variables you use inside of loops (and can move outside to where they won't  
be allocated every time, like the private section of your class, the more speedy the code can be....
the highlighting loop is suboptimal... it iterates over the entire document... it should only iterate over lines that are edited
or if you're going keep it the way it is atm, it needs to be moved into to another thread
the highlighter only has to make one complete pass (on doc load) then it can do it line by line
making it like way faster 

There should be one editor open per syntax type... + one editor open for the NULL Syntax.

Now some general optmizations

Use as little memory as possible as long as it doesn't mess with speed
value speed over memory except in outrageous mem usage cases
any variable that is in an event loop will be alocated every time the even
is called so move it into the class so no allocations of it take place
